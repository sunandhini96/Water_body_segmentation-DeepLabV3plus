# Task : Water Body Segmentation using DeepLabV3plus

This project implements water body segmentation using the DeepLabV3+ model. It includes code for training the model, evaluating its performance, and metrics calculations.

## Files Required:

- `deeplabv3Ex.py`: DeepLabV3+ model
- `train2.py`: Training the model code
- `eval.py`: Model evaluation code
- `metrics.py`: Evaluation metrics code

## Installation:

git clone https://github.com/sunandhini96/Water_body_segmentation-DeepLabV3plus.git

cd Water_body_segmentation-DeepLabV3plus


## Usage:

### Run the training script to train the model:
   
python train2.py

### To evaluate the trained model:

python eval.py

## Dataset:

The project uses RGB satellite images and corresponding masks from Sentinel-2 A/B satellite. You can obtain the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/franciscoescobar/satellite-images-of-water-bodies
